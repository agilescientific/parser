    "Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as \"Cambrian series\") by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin name of Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed.\n",
    "The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerst√§tte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \"soft\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells.\n",
    "As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.\n",
